# React

## Why react
It makes it easy to manage and build complex front end. There are apps in which you click one button and things get updated on multiple different places in app. Doing this is difficult in ordinary DOM

before react the problem was : state(variables) maintained in js
UI updation handled by DOM

So there was no sync between js and DOM Then react came into picture and gave a consistent way of updating dom elements. This is the super power of react. It gives consistancy in UI.
